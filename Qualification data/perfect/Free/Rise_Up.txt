Rise up from the floor, No we won’t never find, A world where we could be ourselves When we stand up to be counted, we will be over, Every heart will beat For a chance to live, not fight, We will break, we will break the walls, This revolution’s cry, we will cry out, We will never fall, We will never fall, we will never fall.
