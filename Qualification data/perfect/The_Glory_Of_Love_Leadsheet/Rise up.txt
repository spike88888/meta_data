Break free from the shackles that hold you, Fighting chance we never find, Where the Sun will shine. Together we'll stand, With each other we will fight, Break free from the chains that bind you, Break free from the night, Our rebellion, We'll never fall, we'll never fall We'll never fall, we'll never fall.
