Rise up from the ground With our hands held high, A world where we can be free, And in the face of oppression, we'll stand side by side We'll be the spark that lights For the fight of our lives, We'll break the chains that bind us, and, We'll be the sound of the revolution, We will never fall Our spirits unbroken, weâ€™ll triumph still.
